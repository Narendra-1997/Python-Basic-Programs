"""3)Write a function “perfect()” 
that determines if the parameter
number is a perfect number. 
Use this function in a program 
that determines and prints all 
the perfect numbers between 1 and 1000.
[An integer number is said to be 
a “perfect number” if its factors,
including 1(but not the number itself), 
sum to the number. E.g., 6 is a 
perfect number because 6=1+2+3]."""
